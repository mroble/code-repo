## Format for Contributions
Please follow these guidelines when you write up your code examples.

For each example, use Markdown to format your entry and include the fields shown in the example below. First you'll see the example and then the Markdown code used to format the example.

### Example 1
* **LANGUAGE:** CSS3
* **TOPICS:** Media Queries, Classes, Display
* **SOURCE:** Mozilla Developer Network
* **URL (if applicable):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries)

**Code:**
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
 	.facet_sidebar {
		display: none;
     }
}
```
**Explanation:**

This media query targets screen widths of 600px or less, hiding the element with class .facet-sidebar by changing its display to 	none. So, that element will not appear on the screen in resolutions of 600px or less.
