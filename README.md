# Code Repo
A collection of code to take our language skills to the next level. Note that code is organized by language first. Any code related to a specific language library or framework can be found within that language's folder.

## Introduction
Born from a desire to get better at the code we can produce, this project's purpose is to provide the community with as many code examples as possible. 

According to research, the brain has the ability to pick up on patterns by seeing those patterns repeatedly over time. In learning a programming language, it is important to provide our brains with this type of input, in order to really integrate the knowledge needed to become rockstar developers (I mean, who doesn't want to become a rock star?). 

Thus, this project proposes to bridge the gap between a theoretical understanding of code to being able to produce that code when we are doing development work. To get to that production level, we must expose ourselves to as much code as possible. Code Repo purports to do just that! Enjoy.

## Contributions

This project would not be possible without code contributions from the community. We greatly appreciate any and all contributions to our code examples. If you are looking to contribute, head on over to Contributions to learn the proper formatting and methods for submissions. Thanks!
